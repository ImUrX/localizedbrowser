A mod that makes things nicer for people that don't talk english.

Current features are:
* Base letter shows all possible graphemes with it
* If you use a grapheme it will only show items with that grapheme
* Advanced Japanese support (romaji, hiragana shows katakana stuff, kanji dictionary, and the features above do apply to japanese too)

To-do:
* Pinyin support (chinese one, need to check if taiwan has something different)
* Romaja support (korean one)
* Check if more languages need romanization support or something like japanese.
